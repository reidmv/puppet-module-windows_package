# windows_package type/provider #

This is the Package type/provider from Puppet 3.0 extracted from the 3.0
codebase and turned into a new type/provider for Puppet 2.7 called
"windows_package".  It is used in exactly the same way as the package type, but
only works on Windows and adds the additional package management functionality
available from the 'windows' package provider.
