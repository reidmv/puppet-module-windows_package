# WPackage type/provider #

This is the Package type/provider from Puppet 3.0 extracted from the 3.0
codebase and turned into a new type/provider for Puppet 2.7 called "wpackage".
It is used in exactly the same way as the package type, but only works on
Windows and adds the additional package management functionality available from
the 'windows' package provider.
